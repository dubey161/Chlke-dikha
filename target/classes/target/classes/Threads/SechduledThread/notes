🔹 1. shutdown()
What it does

Initiates an orderly shutdown

Stops accepting new tasks

Already submitted tasks continue execution

Does NOT block the calling thread (main thread continues)

Important Points

No interruption of running tasks

Tasks in queue will execute

Common interview line:

shutdown() allows already submitted tasks to complete normally

Interview Question

❓ Does shutdown interrupt running threads?
✅ No

🔹 2. awaitTermination(timeout, unit)
What it does

Blocks the calling thread

Waits up to given timeout

Returns:

true → Executor terminated within timeout

false → Timeout expired, executor still running

Important Points

Must be called after shutdown()

Does NOT force shutdown

It is purely a status check

Interview Question

❓ Does awaitTermination stop threads?
✅ No, it only waits and checks

🔹 3. shutdownNow()
What it does

Attempts immediate shutdown

Interrupts running tasks

Returns list of waiting (not started) tasks

Important Points

Best-effort interruption

Running threads may stop only if they handle interruption

Sleeping threads get InterruptedException

Interview Question

❓ Is shutdownNow guaranteed to stop all tasks?
✅ No (best effort)

2️⃣ SCHEDULED THREAD POOL – DETAILED NOTES
🔹 What is ScheduledExecutorService?

Child of ExecutorService

Used for delayed & periodic execution

Replacement for Timer

🔹 Scheduling Methods
1️⃣ schedule(Runnable, delay, unit)

Executes once after delay

2️⃣ schedule(Callable, delay, unit)

Executes once

Returns result via Future

3️⃣ scheduleAtFixedRate(...)

Runs repeatedly at fixed rate

Time counted from start time

If task takes longer → executions may bunch together

4️⃣ scheduleWithFixedDelay(...)

Delay counted after previous task completes

Prevents overlapping executions

🔹 Fixed Rate vs Fixed Delay (INTERVIEW GOLD)
Feature	Fixed Rate	Fixed Delay
Timer starts	From start time	After task completes
Overlapping risk	Yes	No
Use case	Heartbeats, metrics	Batch jobs, cleanup
